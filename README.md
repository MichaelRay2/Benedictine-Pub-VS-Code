## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with the a minimalstic approach where the experience is as easy as possible for the user with only 3 pages. The dark red-ish tones of the site aim to give the user a feel of the pub as they match what is inside the pub.

### Colour
I decided upon the colour based on the fact I wanted most of the text to be white as I believe this looks the most professional. Therefore, a maroon, dark red-ish colour would be a suitable colour scheme for this text. The interior of the pub also contains a lot of dark red.

### Fonts
After some research it seemed like the nost professional font and the font that was most used for pubs was the "Open-Sans" font. Therefore, this font was used.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the restaurant logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. On larger screens this navigation links don't require an extra click.
The website consists of three separate pages: 
- A home page with 4 sections. 
    1) section for header. 
    2) Section for about-us info.
    3) Section to display the pubs venues.
    4) Section to display the pubs location.
- A page that shows the Live Sports the pub shows. 2 sections.
    1) section for header
    2) section for Live Sports

### Logo and Navigation Bar
- Featured on all three pages. The header section is smaller on the 2 pages that are not the home page.
- The navbar is fully responsive and changes to a toggler (hamburger menu icon) on smaller screens and includes
links to the Homepage, Live Sports, and Book a Venue.
- An "x" icon allowes the user to close the nav menu when they're done using it.
- It allows users to easily navigate the page irrespective of screen size.
- When the user hovers over a link, the link will reveal a blue underline.

### Header and header button link to Facebook
- The current main method of communication of the pub is through Facebook. Therefore, it is important to have a large button for the user to get to the facebook page.
- Within the header on the main page the user will be able to see a contact number and opening times. This is only visible on the home page as it would take up unnecessary space on the other pages.
